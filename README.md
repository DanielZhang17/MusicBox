# MusicBox
A simple material design demo client using JavaFX for CSCI 2141 that performs CRUD database operations. Since this was to demonstrate
the use of CRUD operations of MySQL databases in a GUI based client and is for demo purpose of the course only, the playback control buttons were not fully implemented and songs shown are for demo purposes as well.
